## How to use:
To use the Notebooks and the WebApp, you'll need to first create python environment and install the required packages using pip:
1. `python -m venv .venv`
2. On Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2b. On Windows: `.venv/Scripts/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Notebooks
Before running the notebooks, place the respective datasets folders in the data folder:
- CIFAKE contents into CIFAKE folder
- RealVsAiArt contents into RealVsAiArt folder

### WebApp
To run the webapp, use the `./start_webapp` script

## TODOs
Final TODOs:
- [ ] Update scripts
- [ ] Report
    - [ ] Add final part in introduction (or is it ready like this?)
    - [ ] Write the rest
- [ ] CIFAKE notebook improve
- [ ] Write beamer slides
- [ ] COOL EXPERIMENT: TRY USING CIFAKE MODEL ON RVAA (will do it in the future)
