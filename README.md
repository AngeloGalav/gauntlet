2. On Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2b. On Windows: `.venv/Scripts/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Notebooks
Before running the notebooks, place the respective datasets folders in the data folder:
- CIFAKE contents into CIFAKE folder
- RealVsAiArt contents into RealVsAiArt folder

### WebApp
To run the webapp, use the `./start_webapp` script
